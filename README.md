# Claude Code Parallelization & Automation Test Sandbox

## Overview
This repository serves as a test environment for exploring and documenting all possible ways to parallelize and automate tasks with Claude Code. We'll systematically test different approaches, document successes and failures, and build a knowledge base of effective patterns.

## Project Goals
- Discover effective parallelization strategies for Claude Code
- Test automation capabilities and limitations
- Document successful patterns and anti-patterns
- Build a reference library of working examples
- Learn from both successes and failures

## Repository Structure
- `planning/` - Project planning documents, roadmaps, and strategies
- `communication/` - Documentation of communication patterns and protocols
- `tasks/` - Task implementations and experiments
- `research/` - Research findings, analysis, and insights

## Experiments & Results
Track record of our experiments will be documented here as we progress.

## Contributing
This is an experimental sandbox - all ideas and approaches are welcome for testing.
